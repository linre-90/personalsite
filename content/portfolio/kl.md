# Kiinteistö Oy Koivikko-Lisälä

The primary criteria for the websites were reliability, simplicity, and ease of use. This led us to opt for a static, traditional website. Additionally, the fact that the content didn't require constant updates favored the use of Hugo and traditional web technologies. Speed and user-friendliness were also top priorities for the websites.

## Technical implementation

Custom themes were created for the websites using Hugo. The content itself is written in Markdown, utilizing Hugo theme parameters. Hugo is quite similar to traditional themes in platforms like WordPress. Hugo has its own hierarchy to locate the appropriate template from project directories. The website is built into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing it to be hosted in a static hosting environment, significantly reducing costs.

Although there's currently no need for continuous content updates, the website is relatively easy to migrate to a platform like WordPress because the content and presentation are separated from each other.
