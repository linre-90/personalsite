We participated in a 4-day game jam event with three other students. The theme for the jam was to create a Halloween-themed game. The playable character in the game is a scarecrow who lost its pumpkin head when a soccer ball hit it. Accidentally, the character placed the soccer ball on its neck and realized that it worked just as well. Frustrated by the scarecrow academy's false claim that only a pumpkin works as a head, it decided to embark on a revenge journey.

## Technical implementation

The game was developed using the Unity game engine with the URP rendering pipeline. I was primarily responsible for the coding, but we also divided the work among other team members based on their strengths. Considering the limited time, the game turned out surprisingly well.

> Our modeler did an excellent job with the 3D models, and I believe the visual style turned out really successful.
