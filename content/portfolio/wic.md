[Repository is in github!](https://github.com/linre-90/WIC2.0)


WIC (WebP Image Converter) is an application written in Python that converts image files to the WebP format. It can be cloned from GitHub, and instructions are provided to run it directly from a desktop shortcut. WIC provides a convenient way to convert images to the WebP format, allowing users to optimize their images for web use efficiently.

## Technology
Wic is a desktop application created in Python. Originally a command-line application, it was redesigned with a TK GUI for improved usability. To run Wic or "install" it, users need to clone the repository, install Python, and create a virtual environment. The Wic repository includes helper scripts to install dependencies and launch the application seamlessly.

WIC (WebP Image Converter) makes converting images to the desired compression level easy and intuitive. The program provides informative messages to users, indicating where and how many images were converted during the process. I rely on WIC regularly whenever I update web pages, as it simplifies the image conversion process significantly.
