Hi, I'm Juho. I'm a software developer specializing in the gaming industry. Additionally, I've explored the world of web development and mobile devices through education and
various types of projects. Currently, I'm proficient with various technologies, including React, Java, and C#. I also know relational and object databases like MongoDb and MySQL.

\
My main areas of interest are full-stack web development and game development. Mobile applications also pique my interest,
and I've created a few for the Android platform. I've deployed backend services for applications on platforms like Amazon, Heroku, and Google Firebase. 
I graduated from a game development program in 2023 and have received additional education from the University of Helsinki and XAMK University of
Applied Sciences. However, I've been passionate about programming even before pursuing formal education, so I have approximately 5 years of experience through my hobby.
