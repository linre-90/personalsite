I'm Juho, deeply passionate about full-stack web development, game programming, and embedded/electronics projects. While my embedded experience largely stems from Arduino/Raspberry experimentation in my free time, I'm eager to delve further into this realm.
\
\
I hold a degree in game development, and I've recently been expanding my skill set through open education from the University of Applied Sciences and specialized university courses. This diverse background not only enhances my technical proficiency but also equips me with the ability to effectively collaborate with clients, understanding their needs and tailoring solutions to fit their unique use cases.
\
\
Proficient in coding with C# and C-family languages, I've also ventured into projects involving languages like Go and Python. My expertise extends to full-stack web development, where I'm adept at utilizing popular frameworks such as React and Express. While I have experience with MongoDB, both in cloud and local environments, I personally lean towards SQL databases.
\
\
Beyond my IT endeavors, I bring valuable experience from sectors such as logistics and the metal industry. Moreover, my background as a electrician adds another dimension to my skill set, amplifying my capabilities across various domains.
\
\
I'm a individual who thrives on encountering new challenges and resolving problems. I'm deeply passionate about continuous learning, constantly updating my existing skills and embracing new ones.
